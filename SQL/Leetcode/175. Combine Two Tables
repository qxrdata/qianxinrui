Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:
FirstName, LastName, City, State

--------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis: the query ask for joining two tables, person and address, regardless if no address exists, this means we will use left join to include all people from the Person table. 

provide asked information -> SELECT P.FirstName, P.LastName, A.City, A.State
joining two tables and include all info from Person table -> FROM Person left join Address on on P.PersonId = A.PersonId


Solution: SELECT P.FirstName, P.LastName, A.City, A.State FROM PERSON AS P LEFT JOIN ADDRESS AS A on P.PersonId = A.PersonId
