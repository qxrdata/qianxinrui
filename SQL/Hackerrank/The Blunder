Analysis: we need the difference between the actual average salary and the miscalculated salary

To remove o from salary number -> REPLACE(SALARY, '0', '')
To calculate average salary -> avg(salary) 
To calculate average of miscalcalculated salary -> avg(REPLACE(SALARY, '0', ''))
To calculate the difference -> avg(salary) - avg(REPLACE(SALARY, '0', ''))
To get the next rounded number: CAST(CEIL(AVG(salary) - AVG(CAST(REPLACE(SALARY, '0', '')))))

Query: SELECT CAST(CEIL(avg(Salary) - avg(CAST(REPLACE(Salary, '0', '')AS FLOAT)))AS FLOAT) AS Difference FROM Employees

Keypoint: REPLACE(), AVG(), CEIL(), CAST()
Note: REPLACE() implicitly converts float into string, avg() on a string will return an error, therefore we need to convert the salary with CAST() to a float type
      CAST() function converts a value (of any type) into a specified datatype.
